taskt allows you to automate the boring stuff and create efficienies by giving you the power to craft a digital workforce that executes and performs rule-based automation.  No API? No Problem!  Included is a "what you see is what you get" bot designer with dozens of automation commands. An element recorder and screen recorder is also included that can record and replay scripted automation.

![How does taskt work?](https://i.imgur.com/TxrH6YH.png)
taskt works by allowing a bot developer to design a bot configuration known as a script.  The bot configuration is then intepreted by a script engine at run-time and executes against the bot developer's selected parameter inputs.  Each command contains the definitions for the required inputs as well as the required logic at run-time.  Please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/saucepleez/taskt/wiki) for basic documenation surrounding the application and the available commands

taskt can perform automation on both web and desktop applications, simulating the actions a person would do. Taskt can start and stop processes, launch VB and PowerShell scripts, work directly with Excel workbooks, and perform OCR (OneNote installation required) among many other functions.
