taskt allows you to automate the boring stuff and create efficienies by giving you the power to craft a digital workforce that executes and performs rule-based automation.  No API? No Problem!  Included is a "what you see is what you get" bot designer with dozens of automation commands. An element recorder and screen recorder is also included that can record and replay scripted automation.

![How does taskt work?](https://i.imgur.com/TxrH6YH.png)
taskt works by allowing a bot developer to design a bot configuration known as a script.  The bot configuration is then intepreted by a script engine at run-time and executes against the bot developer's selected parameter inputs.  Each command contains the definitions for the required inputs as well as the required logic at run-time.

![What can taskt do?](https://i.imgur.com/FTMRTi8.png)
taskt can perform automation on both web and desktop applications, simulating the actions a person would do.  From swivel-chair data entry to report generation, taskt can handle your automation needs.  Prefer to write and implement code?  taskt can use your existing .NET DLLs and services additionally with the ability to compile code on the fly using the Custom Code command! taskt can start and stop processes, launch VB and PowerShell scripts, work directly with Excel workbooks, and perform OCR (OneNote installation required) among many other functions.  You can review all the automation commands by clicking [here](https://github.com/rcktrncn/taskt-wiki/blob/master/automation-commands.md).
